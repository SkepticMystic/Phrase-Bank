### Note on Writing Abstracts

↑ Writing Abstracts

%%An abstract is a short statement that describes a much longer piece of writing or a prospective conference presentation. Abstracts for research papers or theses should provide the reader with a quick overview of the entire study. Abstracts written for PhDs typically contain the following elements:%%

> Importance of the topic <br>_and/or_<br>Reference to the current literature<br>_and/or_<br>Identification of a knowledge gap. Aim(s) of the current study. Indication of the methods used. **Statement of the key finding(s)**. Implications of the findings<br>_and/or_ <br> Value of the current study

%%The first three elements listed above are grouped together because, although they may substitute each other, it is possible to find all three together. However, it is also possible to find PhD abstracts where none of them are present. Of all the elements listed above, only the ‘aims of the current study’ and the ‘statement of key findings’ appear to be obligatory and so these appear here in bold. Note that all except the last two may also be found in the introductory section of a research paper.<br>The last two are normally found in the discussion and conclusion sections. Phrases associated with all these elements are listed below.%%

### Writing Acknowledgements

%%The ‘acknowledgments’ sections in PhD theses are not simply a polite formality. They are important because they reveal and pay tribute to the other people and to the bodies who made the research possible. Typically included are: funding organisations, research institutes, institutions, supervisors, collaborators, close colleagues and family members. In the majority of cases, the structure moves from acknowledging the more formal support (funding bodies, institutions, supervisors) to the most familiar (close friends and family members). The phrases listed below illustrate some of the ways that thanks and appreciation can be expressed.%%

| Firstly,<br>Secondly, <br>Finally, | I wish to<br>I want to<br>I would like to | thank $X$<br>extend my thanks to $X$<br>express my gratitude to $X$<br>give a special thank you to $X$ | for his constant<br>for her continuous | advice.<br>support.<br>tolerance.<br>patience.<br>guidance.<br>forbearance.<br>reassurance.<br>encouragement. |

### Evidence-based

↑ Academic Writing

%%Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of written academic style is that it is evidence-based. Writers support their arguments and claims with evidence from the body of knowledge relevant to their discipline. In addition, any research that is undertaken must make reference to previous work in the field. As a result, academic texts are rich in attributions to other writers and references to previous research, as seen in the examples below:%%

Previous studies have shown that ...
These sources suggest that from the fifth century onwards ....
According to the 1957 Annual Medical Report, the death of the 960 inhabitants of ...
However, as has been shown elsewhere (e.g. Smith, 1992), the increase in ...
This can be seen in the case of ...
A good example of this can be found in ...

### Words of Classical Origin

↑ Academic Writing

%%Unlike everyday English, academic writing is characterised by a high frequency of words of classical origin (Greek and Latin). The main reason for this is that Latin was the _lingua academica_ during the European renaissance; in other words, it was the international language of scholars. Even up until relatively recently, great works of science, such as Isaac Newton’s _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ (1687), were written in Latin. Where academic texts were written in English, words of classical origin were used for concepts and phenomena for which there was no equivalent in English.%%

%%Although the _lingua academica_ of today is English, writers of academic English still tend to use words which are derived from Latin, and also, mainly through Latin, from Greek.%%

-tx-
:-: | :-: | :-: |
|everyday words |<br><br>→ |academic words |
|a lot of<br> big<br>bring together<br>get rid of <br>not enough<br>story<br>thing<br>trouble<br> way (of doing)<br>worry |^^|considerable<br>significant<br>synthesise<br>eradicate<br>insufficient<br>anecdote<br>object<br>difficulty<br>method<br>concern |

%%There are also some changes to grammatical words (though these are not of classical origin):%%

-tx-
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|everyday words |<br>→ |academic words |
|not much research<br> not many studies<br>isn’t any evidence |^^|little research<br>few studies<br>no evidence |

### Cautious

↑ Academic Writing

%%Academic writers are careful about the claims they make: they take care not to appear certain where some doubt may exist, and they are careful not to over-generalise. An example of this kind of transformation can be seen below. The second sentence is in academic style:%%

Some studies suggest that drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer in women.

### Impersonal

↑ Academic Writing

%%In the interests of objectivity, academic writers tend to remove themselves from the writing. The focus is on ‘what’ happened, ‘how’ it was done, and ‘what’ was found. The ‘who’ (the writer) is not normally given very much attention. This is one of the reasons why personal pronouns (‘I’ and ‘we’) tend not to be used. In addition, academic texts rarely address the reader directly and the pronoun normally used for this, ‘you’, is avoided. The second sentence is in academic style:%%

_You could say that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War. _<br>
<font style='font-size:35'>⬇</font><br> _It can be said that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War._

%%There are some exceptions: in certain disciplines, it may be appropriate for a writer to explain their personal interest in the research area. In some disciplines, the researcher may participate in the research as a participant-observer. In these cases, ‘I’ will be used. The example below, which illustrates the former situation, is taken from a dissertation in History.%%

I became interested in $X$ after reading  
I hope to convey some of my fascination for the subject, as well as expressing my admiration of the artistic achievements of those involved.

%%In research undertaken by teams, for example in medicine and science, it is common for the research to be reported using the personal pronoun, e.g. ‘we’.%%
