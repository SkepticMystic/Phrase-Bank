## Speculations

%%(source: ref-n-write)%%

- suspect

It remains unclear to which degree X are attributed to X
However, X does seem to improve X
This does seem to depend on X
It is important to note, that the present evidence relies on X
The results show that X does not seem to impact the X
However, the extent to which it is possible to X is unknown
Alternatively, it could simply mean that X
It is difficult to explain such results within the context of X
It is unclear whether this is a suitable for X
This appears to be a case of X
From this standpoint, X can be considered as X
To date, Xremain unknown
Under certain assumptions, this can be construed as X
Because of this potential limitation, we treat X
In addition, several questions remain unanswered.
At this stage of understanding, we believeX
Therefore, it remains unclear whether X
This may explain why X


## Deductive Arguments

%%(source: ref-n-write)%%

- logically
- therefore
- hence
- necessarily
- deduction

A difference between these X can only be attributable to X
Nonetheless, we believe that it is well justified to X
This may raise concerns about X which can be addressed by X
As discussed, this is due to the fact that X
Results demonstrate that this is not necessarily true.
These findings support the notion that X is not influenced by X
This may be the reason why we did not find X
In order to test whether this is equivalent across X, we X
Therefore, X can be considered to be equivalent for X
