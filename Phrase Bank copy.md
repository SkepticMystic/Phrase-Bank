## Introducing

%%There are many ways to introduce an academic essay or short paper. Most academic writers, however, appear to do one or more of the following in their introductions: establish the context, background and/or importance of the topic; indicate an issue, problem, or controversy in the field of study; define the topic or key terms; state the purpose of the essay or piece of writing; provide an overview of the coverage and/or structure of the writing%%

%%Slightly less complex introductions may simply inform the reader: what the topic is, why it is important, and how the writing is organised. In very short assignments, it is not uncommon for a writer to commence simply by stating the purpose of their writing and by indicating how it is organised.%%

%%Introductions to research dissertations and theses tend to be relatively short compared to the other sections of the text but quite complex in terms of their functional elements. Some of the more common elements include: establishing the context, background and/or importance of the topic; giving a brief review of the relevant academic literature; identifying a problem, controversy or a knowledge gap in the field of study; stating the aim(s) of the research and the research questions or hypotheses; providing a synopsis of the research design and method(s); explaining the significance or value of the study; defining certain key terms; providing an overview of the dissertation or report structure%%

%%Examples of phrases which are commonly employed to realize these and other functions are listed under the headings that follow. Note that there may be a certain amount of overlap between some of the categories under which the phrases are listed. Also, the order in which the different categories of phrases are shown reflects a typical order but this is far from fixed or rigid, and not all the elements are present in all introductions.%%

## Reviewing the Literature

%%One of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already known, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already been developed. Thus, in academic texts, writers frequently make reference to other studies and to the work of other authors. It is important that writers guide their readers through this literature. This section of _Academic Phrasebank_ lists some of the phrases that writers may use for this purpose.%%

%%A note on the literature review: It is the purpose of the literature review section of a paper or dissertation to show the reader, in a systematic way, what is already known about the research topic as a whole, and to outline the key ideas and theories that help us to understand this. As well as being systematic, the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas which are relevant to the current work. For example, you may think a particular study did not investigate some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the author(s) failed to notice a weakness in their methods, or that their conclusion is not well-supported (refer to _Being Critical_).%%

%%A note on referencing style: The way a writer refers to other sources varies somewhat across different disciplines. In some cases, where the individual author is important, the author’s name will be the main subject of the sentence; in other cases, the author’s name may only be mentioned in brackets ( …) or via a number notation system (e.g. footnotes and endnotes). The ‘author as subject’ style is less common in the empirical disciplines (sciences) and more commonly used in the humanities. Different referencing systems are used in different disciplines. In the majority of the examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing system has been used.%%

%%A note on verb tenses: ==For general reference to the literature, the present perfect tense (have/has + verb participle) tends to be used==. For reference to specific studies carried out in the past, the simple past tense is most commonly used. ==This is normally the case where a specific date or point in time in the past forms a part of the sentence==. ==When referring to the words or ideas of writers, the present tense is often used if the ideas are still relevant, even if the author is no longer alive==. The examples given below reflect these general patterns, but these are by no means rigid.%%

## Describing Methods

%%In the Methods section of a dissertation or research article, writers give an account of how they carried out their research. The Methods section should be clear and detailed enough for another experienced person to repeat the research and reproduce the results. Where the methods chosen are new, unfamiliar or perhaps even controversial, or where the intended audience is from many disciplines, the Methods section will tend to be much more extensive. Typical stretches of text found in this section of a research article or dissertation along with examples of the kind of language used for these are listed below. Note that for many of the functional categories listed later in this section, the verbs are written in the simple past tense and are in the passive voice.%%

## Reporting Results

%%The standard approach to this section of a research article or dissertation is to present and describe the results in a systematic and detailed way. When reporting qualitative results, the researcher will highlight and comment on the themes that emerge from the analysis. These comments will often be illustrated with excerpts from the raw data. In text based studies, this may comprise quotations from the primary sources. In quantitative studies, the results section is likely to consist of tables and figures, and writers comment on the significant data shown in these. This often takes the form of the location or summary statement, which identifies the table or figure and indicates its content, and a highlighting statement or statements, which point out and describe the relevant or significant data. All figures and tables should be numbered and given a title.%%

%%More elaborate commentary on the results is normally restricted to the Discussion section. In research articles, however, authors may comment extensively on their results as they are presented, and it is not uncommon for the Results section to be combined with the Discussion section under the heading: Results and Discussion.%%

## Discussing Findings

%%The term ‘discussion’ has a variety of meanings in English. In academic writing, however, it usually refers to two types of activity: a) considering both sides of an issue, or question before reaching a conclusion; b) considering the results of research and the implications of these. Discussion sections in dissertations and research articles are probably the most complex sections in terms of their elements. They normally centre around a 'statement of result' or an important 'finding'. As there is usually more than one result, discussion sections are often structured into a series of discussion cycles. The most common elements in these cycles, and some of the language that is typically associated with them, are listed below. Note that when offering explanations and suggesting implications the language used is very tentative or cautious (refer to the section entitled _Expressing Caution_).%%

## Writing Conclusions

%%Conclusions are shorter sections of academic texts which usually serve two functions. The first is to summarise and bring together the main areas covered in the writing, which might be called ‘looking back’; and the second is to give a final comment or judgement on this. The final comment may also include making suggestions for improvement and speculating on future directions.%%

%%In dissertations and research papers, conclusions tend to be more complex and will also include sections on the significance of the findings and on recommendations for future work. In some research papers, the conclusion is not presented separately from the discussion section; the two sections may be combined. However, separate conclusions are nearly always expected for dissertations and essays.%%

## Writing Abstracts 

An abstract is a short statement that describes a much longer piece of writing or a prospective conference presentation. Abstracts for research papers or theses should provide the reader with a quick overview of the entire study. Abstracts written for PhDs typically contain the following elements:

>Importance of the topic <br>*and/or*<br>Reference to the current literature<br>*and/or*<br>Identification of a knowledge gap

>Aim(s) of the current study

>Indication of the methods used

> **Statement of  the key finding(s)**

>Implications of the findings<br>*and/or* <br> Value of the current study

The first three elements listed above are grouped together because, although they may substitute each other, it is possible to find all three together. However, it is also possible to find PhD abstracts where none of them are present. Of all the elements listed above, only the ‘aims of the current study’ and the ‘statement of key findings’ appear to be obligatory and so these appear here in bold. Note that all except the last two may also be found in the introductory section of a research paper.<br>The last two are normally found in the discussion and conclusion sections.

## Writing Acknowledgements 

The ‘acknowledgments’ sections in PhD theses are not simply a polite formality. They are important because they reveal and pay tribute to the other people and to the bodies who made the research possible.  Typically included are: funding organisations, research institutes, institutions, supervisors, collaborators, close colleagues and family members. In the majority of cases, the structure moves from acknowledging the more formal support (funding bodies, institutions, supervisors) to the most familiar (close friends and family members). The phrases listed below illustrate some of the ways that thanks and appreciation can be expressed.

|Firstly,<br>Secondly, <br>Finally,  |I wish to<br>I want to<br>I would like to |thank $X$<br>extend my thanks to $X$<br>express my gratitude to $X$<br>give a special thank you to $X$|for his constant<br>for her continuous |advice.<br>support.<br>tolerance.<br>patience.<br>guidance.<br>forbearance.<br>reassurance.<br>encouragement.|

# Notes on Academic Writing 

## A Note on Academic Style 

The principal characteristics of written academic style are listed below.

### 1. Evidence-based 

Perhaps the most important distinguishing feature of written academic style is that it is evidence-based. Writers support their arguments and claims with evidence from the body of knowledge relevant to their discipline. In addition, any research that is undertaken must make reference to previous work in the field. As a result, academic texts are rich in attributions to other writers and references to previous research, as seen in the examples below:

- Previous studies have shown that ...
- These sources suggest that from the fifth century onwards ....
- According to the 1957 Annual Medical Report, the death of the 960 inhabitants of ...
- However, as has been shown elsewhere (e.g. Smith, 1992), the increase in ...

For further examples, refer to the section on *[[John Morley - Manchester Phrasebank 2018#Referring to the Literature to Justify a Method or Approach|Referring to the Literature]]* in this document.

In addition, general propositions are usually supported with real examples.

- *This can be seen in the case of ...*
- *A good example of this can be found in ...*

### 2. Words of Classical Origin 

Unlike everyday English, academic writing is characterised by a high frequency of words of classical origin (Greek and Latin). The main reason for this is that Latin was the *lingua academica* during the European renaissance; in other words, it was the international language of scholars. Even up until relatively recently, great works of science, such as Isaac Newton’s *Philosophiæ  Naturalis Principia Mathematica* (1687), were written in Latin. Where academic texts were written in English, words of classical origin were used for concepts and phenomena for which there was no equivalent in English.

Although the *lingua academica* of today is English, writers of academic English still tend to use words which are derived from Latin, and also,  mainly through Latin, from Greek.

-tx-
 :-: | :-: | :-: |
|everyday words |<br><br>→ |academic words |
|a lot of<br> big<br>bring together<br>get rid of <br>not enough<br>story<br>thing<br>trouble<br> way (of doing)<br>worry |^^|considerable<br>significant<br>synthesise<br>eradicate<br>insufficient<br>anecdote<br>object<br>difficulty<br>method<br>concern |

There are also some changes to grammatical words (though these are not of classical origin):

-tx-
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
|everyday words |<br>→ |academic words |
|not much research<br> not many studies<br>isn’t any evidence |^^|little research<br>few studies<br>no evidence |

### 3. Cautious 

Academic writers are careful about the claims they make: they take care not to appear certain where some doubt may exist, and they are careful not to over-generalise. An example of this kind of transformation can be seen below. The second sentence is in academic style:

- *Drinking alcohol causes breast cancer in women. *<br>
<font style='font-size:35'>⬇</font><br> *Some studies suggest that drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer in women.*

For more examples of this kind of language, refer to the section on *[[John Morley - Manchester Phrasebank 2018#Being Cautious|Expressing Caution]]*.

### 4. Impersonal 

In the interests of objectivity, academic writers tend to remove themselves from the writing. The focus is on ‘what’ happened, ‘how’ it was done, and ‘what’ was found. The ‘who’ (the writer) is not normally given very much attention. This is one of the reasons why personal pronouns (‘I’ and ‘we’) tend not to be used.  In addition, academic texts rarely address the reader directly and the pronoun normally used for this, ‘you’, is avoided. The second sentence is in academic style:

- *You could say that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War. *<br>
<font style='font-size:35'>⬇</font><br> *It can be said that Churchill made some catastrophic decisions early in the War.*

There are some exceptions: in certain disciplines, it may be appropriate for a writer to explain their personal interest in the research area. In some disciplines, the researcher may participate in the research as a participant-observer. In these cases, ‘I’ will be used. The example below, which illustrates the former situation, is taken from a dissertation in History.

*I became interested in $X$ after reading …… I hope to convey some of my fascination for the subject, as well as expressing my admiration of the artistic achievements of those involved.*

In research undertaken by teams, for example in medicine and science, it is common for the research to be reported using the personal pronoun, e.g.  ‘we’.

### 5. Nominalisation 

There is a tendency for academic writers to transform verbs (actions) into nouns. In the example below, the verb ‘abandoned’ becomes the abstract noun ‘abandonment’.

- *Unwanted Roman children were generally abandoned in a public place. *<br>
<font style='font-size:35'>⬇</font><br>  *The abandonment of unwanted Roman children generally occurred in a public place.*

As a result of this kind of transformation, academic writing is characterised by long noun phrase constructions, as in:  ‘the abandonment of unwanted Roman children’.  In certain cases, these nominalised forms can become long and complex:

- *the effect of reducing aggressiveness by producing an ACTH-mediated condition of decreased androgen levels.*

Although this kind of construction is considered normal in scientific writing, unless the reader is familiar with the constructions, it does make reading difficult as there are so many pieces of information to process in the one sentence. There is an argument that too much nominalisation should be discouraged.

### 6. Rhetorical Questions 

Questions to introduce significant new ideas are avoided, and are replaced with statements:

- *Is the welfare system good or not? *<br>
<font style='font-size:35'>⬇</font><br> *It is important to consider the effectiveness of the British welfare system.*

However, setting out a list of research questions in the introductory section of a research report is quite common.

### 7. Contracted Forms Avoided 

Contracted forms (e.g. *it’s, don’t, isn’t, aren’t*) should not be used in academic writing. The only exception would be if you are transcribing a recorded conversation or interview.

### 8. Precise and Detailed 

Last of all, one of the most noticeable features of academic writing is that it is very precise and detailed. This relates to the setting out and development of the thinking and the ideas, as well as to the language used in the writing.

## A Note on Style in Academic Presentations 

In contrast to written style, the communicative style of academic presentations tends to be much more personal and familiar. The majority of the phrases listed below serve as useful ‘signposts’ for spoken academic presentations. ‘Signposts’ help the listeners follow where the talk is going. Notice how the personal pronouns (‘I’, ‘we’, and ‘you’) are used in most of these phrases.

## A Note on Commonly Confused Words 

Your spellchecker will only indicate words that are misspelt which it does not recognise. However, if the word that you have misspelt is correct when it has a different meaning, the spellchecker will not show you the correct form of the word you want. In these cases, the writer has to know the correct spelling. The list below contains words which are commonly misspelt, as well as words which may be spelt correctly but which are simply confused.

### abbreviation/acronym 

- An *abbreviation* is a shortened form of a word or phrase. Usually, but not always, it consists of a letter or group of letters taken from the word or phrase. *Dr*. and *Prof*. are common examples.
- An *acronym* is an abbreviation formed from the initial components in a phrase or a word. These elements in turn form a new word: *NATO, Benelux, UNESCO.*

### affect/effect 

- *Affect* is a verb, e.g. *A affects B*;
- *Effect* is a noun and is therefore, in its singular form, always used after an article/determiner (‘an’ or ‘the’/’this’), e.g. *The Greenhouse Effect*.

### compliment/complement 

- *Compliment* (verb) means to praise someone.
- *Complement* (verb) means to complete or add something in a way that usually improves it.
- Both words can also be used as nouns.

### comprise/consist 

Both words mean ‘to be made up of’, but only *consist* is accompanied by *of.*

### discrete/discreet 

- *Discrete* is an adjective which means ‘separate’ or ‘distinct’.
- *Discreet* is an adjective which means ‘to keep silent or tactful about something’.

### formerly/formally 

- *Formerly* means ‘earlier’.
- *Formally* means ‘conventionally’ or ‘officially’.

### ie./e.g. 

- *i.e*. is the abbreviation for *id est* which mean ‘that is’ or ‘in other words’.
- *e.g*. is the abbreviation for *exempli gratia* which has the same meaning as ‘for example’ and ‘for instance’.

### its/it's 

- *its* – without an apostrophe - is a possessive determiner similar to 'my' or 'your' .
- *it's* is a contracted form of  'it is' or 'it has' . Note, however, that contracted forms are avoided in academic writing.

### later/latter 

- *Later* is an adverb which means ‘at an advanced point of time’.
- *Latter* is an adjective used to refer to an item listed in a text. It means ‘most recently mentioned’; in other words, the last item.

### practice/practise 

- In British English, *practice* is a noun and *practise* is a verb.
- American English allows both spellings for both forms.

### precede/proceed 

- The verb *precede* means ‘to come before’.
- The verb *proceed* means ‘to go forward’ or ‘to begin to carry out’.

### principle/principal 

- *Principle* is a noun which means ‘a basic belief, theory or rule’.
- *Principal* is an adjective which means ‘main’ or ‘most important’; it can also refer to a head teacher of a school.

### there/their 

- *There* is used to indicate the existence of something, e.g. *There are two famous football teams in Manchester.*
- The word  *their*  is used to indicate possession, i.e. if something belongs to someone or something.

### prescribe/proscribe 

- The verb *prescribe* means to advise or authorise the use of something.
- The verb *proscribe* means to forbid or to restrict.

## A Note on British and Us Spelling 

The most common difference which is noticed in academic writing concerns verbs which end in *ise/yse* Br. or *ize/yze* US:

- *analyse* Br.  v  *analyze* US.
- *industrialise* Br. v  *industrialize* US.
- *summarise* Br. v *summarize* US*.*

This difference also affects the nouns derived from the verbs:

- *organisation* Br.  v  *organization* US.
- *globalisation* Br*.*  v  *globalization* US*.*
- *colonisation* Br. v  *colonization* US.

Another noticeable difference relates to words ending in *re*:

- *centre* Br. v  *center* US.
- *metre* Br. v   *meter* US.
- *litre* Br. v  *liter* US.

Below are some other differences. Can you see any patterns?

|British |US |

If you are writing for a British university or a  British journal, you  should use the British spelling.

## A Note on Punctuation 

As the purpose of punctuation is to make written English easier to read and to make the meaning clear and unambiguous, good, accurate punctuation is important in academic writing.  The following notes highlight points of particular relevance to academic writing.

### 1. Full Stop . 

- To indicate the end of a sentence
- To indicate an abbreviation such as *etc., et al.* (not always used)
- To indicate an omission in a quoted text [ ...].

### 2. Comma , 

- To separate two main parts of a sentence (two clauses)  joined by words such as *and, or, but,*
- To separate a dependent part of a sentence (beginning with words such as *although, when, because*) from the main part, particularly if the dependent part comes first in the sentence
- To indicate additional information*, however relevant it may be,* in a sentence
- To indicate a non-defining relative clause*, which simply provides additional* *information,* in a sentence
- To separate items in a list such as: *apples, oranges, and pears* (note that the final comma before *and* is often omitted).

### 3. Colon : 

- **To introduce an explanation**: The reason the experiment failed was obvious: the equipment was faulty.
- **To introduce a list**, particularly a grammatically complex list. See the example below under semi-colon
- T**o introduce a direct quotatio**n, particularly a long one: Jones (2003) states that: ‘     ’.

### 4. Semi-colon ; 

- **To separate two sentences that are very closely connected in meaning** (optional, in place of a full stop):
	- Some students prefer to write essays; others prefer to give presentations.
- **To separate clearly items in a grammatically complex list:**
	- For Aristotle, motion is of four kinds: (1) motion which ...; (2) motion which ...; (3) motion which ...; and (4) motion which...


### 5. Quotation Marks ‘ ’ / “ ” 

- To indicate a direct quotation
- To highlight words or phrases used in a special or unusual way: *Quotation marks are also called ‘inverted commas’.*

NB  Single quotation marks now seem to be more commonly used than double. For quotations within quotations, use double quotation marks inside single (or single inside double).

### 6. Dash – 

- Generally avoid in formal academic writing.  Replace by colon, semi-colon, or brackets, as appropriate.

## A Note on Article Use 

Article use in English is a very complex area. However, there are a few simple rules which will help you in many situations and these are explained below:

### 1. Singular Countable Nouns 

All singular countable nouns are always preceded by a small modifying word known in grammar as a determiner, and this is often an article (*a/an, the*). Countable words which are common in academic writing and which often cause problems for non-native speakers of English, include: *system, model, method, approach, group, problem, effect, level, investigation, sector, study, participant, condition, category*

Note that even if these words are preceded by attributive nouns or adjectives, a determiner is still needed:

- the greenhouse effect, the transport system, the control group
- a high level, a systematic approach, a rigorous study, an exploratory investigation

### 2. Plural Countable Nouns 

If the writer is thinking about a specific group, then the definite article is normally used:   The books in this collection were published in the 19th or early 20th century.

Otherwise no article is used:

- Learners tend to remember new facts when they are contextualised.

### 3. Uncountable Nouns 

Uncountable nouns are not normally accompanied by an article:

- Science has been defined as a systematic approach to answering questions.
- Reliability is an important quality of any test.

But if they are post-modified by  *of....,*  or  *which* …<br>the definite article is normally used:

- The science of global warming is a complex and controversial area.
- The reliability of this instrument is poor.
- Chemistry is the science which addresses the composition and behaviour of matter.

### 4. Names 

Names and titles are not normally preceded by the definite article (*the*)
- *Manchester University, Manchester*
But this changes if the noun phrase contains a post-modifying structure (*of ...*)
- *The University of Manchester,    The United States of America* or if they contain words like *organisation,* *association or institute*
- *The World Health Organisation, The American Heart Association, The Royal Society. The SETI Institute*

Apart from these simple rules, the other thing you need to do is to check how noun phrases are used in the texts that you read. Make a mental note of this as you read, or check back to the source text when you are writing.

## A Note on Sentence Structure 

### 1. Simple Sentences 

In written English, all sentences contain a Subject → Verb structure. The subject always precedes the verb, except in questions where the order is reversed.

|S |V | |
| :-: | :- | :-: |
|An electron |is |an elementary particle. |

The subject may be one word, but it is usually a group of words centred around a noun. The verb, which can indicate an action, a state, or simply serve to link the subject to other information, may also consist of more than one word. Various other sentence elements may be placed before or after the Subject → Verb structure:

| |S | V | |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :- |
|Between 1933 and 1945, |restrictions |were placed     |on German academics. |

It is common for the subject to consist of many words:

|S |V | |
| - | - | :- |
|The information on various types of wasps and bees in the report |was |useful to environmentalists who were fighting the use of pesticides. |

Sometimes, however, the subject and verb can just be one word each:

|S |V | |
| - | - | :- |
|It |is |almost certain that a lower speed limit will result in fewer injuries to pedestrians. |

These simple sentences always end with a full stop. In academic writing, however, many sentences are more complicated than this simple pattern.

### 2. Complex Sentences 

Many sentences contain more than one Subject → Verb structure, but in a complex sentence one of these parts (known grammatically as clauses) will convey the main meaning and will make sense by itself:

-tx-
| :-: | :- | :-: | :-: |
|Dependent part ||Main part ||
|S |V|S|V |
|Although  findings of recent research | have shown X, |no controlled studies|have been reported.|

The main part of the sentence is also known as the independent part.

The main part of the sentence can also be placed before the dependent part.

Main part

-tx-
|:-|:-|:-|
|S|V| |
|Oral societies |tend to be| more concerned with the present  |

Dependent part

-tx-
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| |S|V| |
|whereas|literate societies|have|a very definite awareness of the past.|

The dependent part of complex sentence is usually preceded by a word or phrase such as: *although, even though, if, even if, when, because, as, since, whereas, while*  (refer to *subordinators* on the next page).

### 3. Compound Sentences 

Some sentences may have two   Subject → Verb structures and each of these convey meaning that can make sense by itself; in other words, there are two main parts.  The two parts may be joined by words like *and, or, but, so*, or by using a semi-colon (;) .

|S |V | |
| :-: | :- | :- |
|Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory |agree |that something is lost as well as gained when people become literate,  |

| |S |V | |
|:- | :-: | :-: | :- |
|but|they |consider |it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many others. |

### 4. Common Problems Relating to Sentence Structure 

It is incorrect to write the dependent part of a complex sentence as a complete sentence with a full stop:

- Whereas literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past.   X
- Although a number of studies have been undertaken.   X

It is incorrect to write two independent parts as one sentence without a joining word.

- Supporters of the ‘Great Divide’ theory agree that something is lost as well as gained when                     people become literate, they consider it is worth losing some benefits in order to obtain many others. X

## A Note on Words and Phrases Used to Connect Ideas 

As well as using simple conjunctions (e.g. *and, but, or*) to link ideas, academic writers have available to them a broad range of more sophisticated words and phrases. Some of the more commonly-used ones are listed below.

| |Words and phrases which link ideas across two sentences<sup>1</sup> |Words or phrases which precede a noun phrase<sup>2</sup> |Subordinators: express relationships within one sentence (with two clauses)<sup>3</sup> |
| :- | :- | - | :- |
|Addition |also<br>moreover<br>in addition<br>furthermore |in addition to | |
|Adversativity |yet<br>however<br>nevertheless<br>on the other hand |despite<br>in spite of<br> |although<br>even though |
|Aspect |in this respect<br>in other respects<br>from this perspective | | |
|Clarification|that is<br>in other words | | |
|Consequence |thus<br>hence<br>therefore<br>as a result<br>consequently | | |
|Contrast|however<br>in contrast<br>on the other hand |unlike<br>in contrast to |while<br>whereas |
|Illustration |for example<br>for instance<br> | | |
|Reason | |due to<br>owing to<br>because of<br>on account of  |as<br>since<br>because |
|Sequence |first<br>first of all<br>secondly<br>finally<br>in conclusion | | |

1. **Words and phrases which link ideas across two sentences**<br>
He did not sleep very much. *However*, he still managed to pass the exam.<br>
He did not sleep very much; *however*, he still managed to pass the exam.

2. **Words or phrases which precede a noun phrase**<br>
*Despite* the lack of sleep, he still managed to pass the exam. <br>
He still managed to pass the exam *despite* the lack of sleep.

3. **Subordinators: express relationships within one sentence (with two clauses)**<br>
*Even though* he was unable to sleep, he still managed to pass the exam. <br>
He still managed to pass the exam *even though* he was unable to sleep.

## A Note on Paragraph Structure 

A pattern that can be identified in many well-written paragraphs is that of a controlling idea followed by supporting information.  The controlling idea, sometimes referred to as the *topic sentence*, introduces a new idea, topic, argument or piece of information into the main text. This is then either explained further or supported by subsequent sentences. This structure can be represented schematically thus:

|Topic Sentence <br>new point, expressed in general terms) |
| :- |
|<br>Supporting Information which may include a combination of:<br>- statistics<br>- examples<br>- quotations<br>- a development in time<br>- an explanation or reason<br>- specific aspects or details<br>- an effect or consequence<br>- reference to previous research |

It is important that the explanatory or supporting information in a paragraph should relate to the topic sentence. If new points or ideas are to be stated, then these should be treated in a separate paragraph. It is also important that the explanatory or supporting information should not repeat the general ideas expressed in the topic sentence.

An example of the kind of paragraph structure suggested above is given below. Note the development from the general idea to the more detailed information. Also note the thematic linking, which is signalled by the words in bold, between the sentences. Each of these words and phrases links back to an idea introduced in the previous sentence. Here, the sentences have been separated.

-tx-
|:-|
|Many children become interested in competitive sport at early ages.<br><br>Early involvement (prior to maturity) in competitive sport often exposes individuals to types of stress that may affect their growth, producing a disruption of the normal growth pattern (Wang, 1978; Brown, 1998).<br><br>Among cyclists the most potentially serious of these disorders is likely to be increased thoracic curvature.<br><br>Cycling alters the anatomical position of the spine (to a flexed position) particularly the thoracic spine, and exposes the anterior portion of the vertebral column to higher compression (Smith, 1998; Jones, 2002).|

## A Note on the Writing Process 

So far this document has been about ‘what we write’. This final section comprises a set of notes which are concerned with ‘how’ we write. It is organised into a series of helpful tips. Although only two pages are devoted to these ideas, together they have the potential to make a significant deference to the quality and quantity of your written output.

### Tip No. 1. the Importance of Planning: 

Research has shown that experienced writers plan extensively. Initially, planning may involve simply generating ideas and exploring the relationships between them schematically, as in the diagram to the right. At a more advanced stage of the planning process, a chapter outline of the thesis or dissertation will be necessary. This will become more detailed as you work on your study. You need to think of a writing plan as a road map. Without a map, you will probably lose your way or travel in circles.

### Tip No. 2. Getting Started: 

Many writers suffer from ‘writers’ block’; they find it difficult to get started. One way of overcoming this is to give yourself a short period of time (say four minutes), and without stopping, write whatever comes into your mind about the topic. The important thing to do is to keep writing, or if you are using a keyboard, to keep typing. Don’t worry about spelling of grammar – just keep producing words. You will be surprised at how much text you will produce, and how many ideas are generated in such a short time. Now you can begin to organise the ideas you have produced, ensuring that they are written in logically developed and grammatically correct sentences.

### Tip No. 3. Be Regular: 

You should timetable yourself so that you have a regular daily writing slot. This may seem obvious, but it is fundamental to ensuring the production of written text.  Timetable a writing period each day, and aim to produce some text every time. How much you produce will vary, and what you produce, even if it is just a few paragraphs, may only be in the initial draft stage. This is not so important. The important thing is that the writing becomes a part of your daily routine. Simply getting your body to sit in front of a computer at a certain time each day will produce results.

### Tip No. 4. Keep a Notebook: 

When we are writing up a major piece of work, many ideas and insights come to us when we are not actually writing. Often, some of the most insightful ideas emerge when we are in a non-focused cognitive state, such as when we are walking, running, or swimming. Unless you can capture these ideas soon after they come to you, they may be lost. A small notebook and a pen is probably the best way to capture these thoughts before they disappear. The notebook itself can become a place where you develop the ideas and even start to formulate how the ideas will be developed in textual form.

### Tip No. 5. Understand the Recursive Process: 

Writing at the academic level is not something we can do once and then leave. It is a recursive process. This means writers return to their initial texts, revising and redrafting them. This process is ongoing. In fact, many writers find it difficult to stop improving their writing, but with time being limited, they try to do as much as they can before the onset of a particular deadline. One thing we do know: successful writers write initial drafts, redraft, work on final drafts and then edit their work.

### Tip No. 6. Read Your Own Writing: 

Read what you have written back to yourself, out loud if necessary, and ask yourself: i) do I understand what I have written? ii) does it sound natural?  Reading your text out load is actually the best way of checking this. If what you have written doesn’t sound right to you when you do this, it is probably badly written. One famous French writer (Gustav Flaubert) used to shout out his manuscripts before sending them off to be published. He claimed that bad writing never passed this simple test.

### Tip No. 7. Stand Back From Your Writing: 

Think of yourself as a mountain climber. Most climbers, during a climb, can only see a few feet in front of their faces. They cannot see the whole mountain. They can see other mountains, but not the one they are climbing. To do this they need to move a few kilometres away. At such a distance, they can see the route they are planning and they can see how their planned route moves up the mountain. As a writer, you should ask yourself:  Is the route to the ‘top’ unbroken? Do all the minor ‘steps’ move upwards? Can the minor ‘steps’ be ‘carried out’ more clearly? The best way to create a sense of distance with your writing is with time:  Leave it a few days, or longer, and comeback to your writing with fresh eyes and with a better sense of the overall structure.

### Tip No. 8. Talk About Your Writing: 

Writing is a very solitary activity and we tend not to talk about it to others. This is quite strange given that we spend so many hours on this activity.  Asking another person to read some of what you have written and to give feedback can be a very useful experience; particularly if the feedback is reciprocal and both of you receive constructive criticism. It is worth bearing in mind that academic writers often receive their papers back from journal editors or publishers asking them to make changes. You might also consider forming a group of writers like yourself. Together you can read each other’s writing and share the feedback.
